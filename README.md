# Spicy Magpie's Boilerplate

## What is it?

It is a design boilerplate for new HTML projects. It provides a base
structure and a toolkit to help developing Web projects, playing nicely
with other frameworks and libraries.

## Why should I use it?

The boilerplate provides a complete environment for you, that automates
some tasks such as writing the sitemap and the cache manifest. It also
provides a default Bower installation, a set of default HTML pages, CSS
stylesheets for mobile design and much more.

## How to install it?

In simple steps:

  - Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/).
  - Install [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com/).
  - Install [Bower](http://bower.io).
  - Get your copy of the boilerplate and extract it.
  - Go to your newly created project directory with the terminal.
  - Run **npm install**.
  - Run **bower install**.

## How to use it?

  - Run **grunt** on your project directory.
  - Open your project directory with your IDE.
  - Edit the values for your project on the **package,json** file.
  - Modify files and watch the changes.
  - In the console, you will see the access URL's. You can watch the changes
  across multiple browsers and devices.

## I finished my project. What else should I do?

  - Run **grunt dist** on your project directory.
  - Publish the content on the __dist/__ directory.

## TODO

  - Write better documentation.
  - Write tests.
  - Add compatibility with SASS, SCSS and LESS.
  - Add compatibility with CoffeeScript.

## License

MIT License. I didn't include it now but will be part of the
better documentation that I promised in the TODO list.
